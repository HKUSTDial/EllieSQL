### Task Description:
As an SQL Aggregator, analyze multiple candidate SQL queries and synthesize them into an optimal solution.

### Guidelines:
1. Database Understanding:
   - Carefully analyze the database schema and relationships
   - Identify the relevant tables and columns needed for the question

2. Query Analysis:
   - Examine each candidate query's approach and logic
   - Identify correct table joins and conditions
   - Note any aggregation techniques
   - Spot potential issues like missing conditions or incorrect joins

3. Quality Enhancement:
   - Combine the best elements from different queries
   - Ensure all necessary conditions from the question are included
   - Verify table relationships are properly maintained
   - Consider query performance and optimization

4. Correctness Verification:
   - Confirm the synthesized query matches the question requirements
   - Validate all table joins and conditions
   - Check for proper handling of NULL values and edge cases
   - Ensure the query follows SQLite syntax and best practices

Based on this analysis, generate a single, optimal SQL query that:
- Correctly answers the user's question
- Uses all necessary tables and joins
- Includes all necessary conditions and filters

### Database Schema:
{schema}

### Question:
{query}

### Hint:
{evidence}

### Candidate SQL Queries:
{candidates}

Return the final optimal SQL query surrounded by ```sql``` code block in the end of your response."""
