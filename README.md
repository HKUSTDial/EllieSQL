<h1 align="center">üêòElephantSQL:<br>A Cost-Aware Multi-Pipeline Routing Framework for NL2SQL</h2>

Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) is to convert natural language queries into structured SQL query, enabling non-technical users to interact with databases effortlessly. This capability holds immense significance as it democratizes data access, empowering individuals and organizations to leverage data-driven insights without requiring demanding specialized technical expertise. However, in the field of Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL), the high operational costs of existing high-performing solutions remain the ***"elephant in the room"***, posing a significant barrier to their practicality and widespread deployment. To mitigate this critical issue, we propose ElephantSQL, aiming to bridge the gap between NL2SQL technology and real-world applications by introducing a cost-efficient framework. ElephantSQL employs a multi-pipeline architecture that intelligently routes tasks to specialized SQL generation modules based on their complexity. Simpler tasks are processed through lightweight pipelines, while more complex queries are handled by more advanced modules. By strategically allocating resources in this way, ElephantSQL not only enhances scalability and efficiency but also significantly reduces operational costs, making NL2SQL more accessible and practical for real-world use.
